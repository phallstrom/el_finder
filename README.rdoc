== el_finder

* http://elrte.org/redmine/projects/elfinder

== Description:

Ruby library to provide server side functionality for elFinder.  elFinder is an
open-source file manager for web, written in JavaScript using jQuery UI.

== Todo:

* Document library.
* Document how to implement custom image size/resize methods.

== Requirements:

The gem, by default, relies upon the 'image_size' ruby gem and ImageMagick's 'mogrify' and 'convert' commands.
These requirements can be changed by implementing custom methods for determining image size
and resizing of an image.

NOTE: There is another ruby gem 'imagesize' that also defines the class ImageSize and requires 'image_size'
If you have that one installed, elfinder will fail.  Make sure you only have 'image_size' installed if you use
the defaults.

== Install:

* Install elFinder (http://elrte.org/redmine/projects/elfinder/wiki/Install_EN)
* Install ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/)
* Do whatever is necessary for your Ruby framework to tie it together.

=== Rails 3

* Add "gem 'el_finder'" to Gemfile
* % bundle install
* Switch to using jQuery instead of Prototype
* Add the following action to a controller of your choosing.

    skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token, :only => ['elfinder']
    def elfinder
      h, r = ElFinder::Connector.new(
        :root => File.join(Rails.public_path, 'system', 'elfinder'),
        :url => '/system/elfinder',
         :perms => {
           /^(Welcome|README)$/ => {:read => true, :write => false, :rm => false},
           '.' => {:read => true, :write => false, :rm => false}, # '.' is the proper way to specify the home/root directory.
           /^test$/ => {:read => true, :write => true, :rm => false},
           'logo.png' => {:read => true},
           /\.png$/ => {:read => false} # This will cause 'logo.png' to be unreadable.  
                                        # Permissions err on the safe side. Once false, always false.
         },
         :extractors => { 
           'application/zip' => ['unzip', '-qq', '-o'], # Each argument will be shellescaped (also true for archivers)
           'application/x-gzip' => ['tar', '-xzf'],
         },
         :archivers => { 
           'application/zip' => ['.zip', 'zip', '-qr9'], # Note first argument is archive extension
           'application/x-gzip' => ['.tgz', 'tar', '-czf'],
           },

      ).run(params)
      headers.merge!(h)
      render (r.empty? ? {:nothing => true} : {:text => r.to_json}), :layout => false
    end

* Or, use ElFinder::Action and el_finder, which handles most of the boilerplate for an ElFinder action:

    require 'el_finder/action'
    class MyController < ApplicationController
      include ElFinder::Action

      el_finder(:action_name) do
        {
          :root => File.join(Rails.public_path, 'system', 'elfinder'),
          :url => '/system/elfinder',
           :perms => {
             /^(Welcome|README)$/ => {:read => true, :write => false, :rm => false},
             '.' => {:read => true, :write => false, :rm => false}, # '.' is the proper way to specify the home/root directory.
             /^test$/ => {:read => true, :write => true, :rm => false},
             'logo.png' => {:read => true},
             /\.png$/ => {:read => false} # This will cause 'logo.png' to be unreadable.  
                                          # Permissions err on the safe side. Once false, always false.
          },
          :extractors => { 
            'application/zip' => ['unzip', '-qq', '-o'], # Each argument will be shellescaped (also true for archivers)
            'application/x-gzip' => ['tar', '-xzf'],
          },
          :archivers => { 
            'application/zip' => ['.zip', 'zip', '-qr9'], # Note first argument is archive extension
            'application/x-gzip' => ['.tgz', 'tar', '-czf'],
          },
        }
      end
    end

* Add the appropriate route to config/routes.rb such as:

    match 'elfinder' => 'home#elfinder'

* Add the following to your layout. The paths may be different depending 
on where you installed the various js/css files.

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'jquery-ui/base/jquery.ui.all', 'elfinder' %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults, 'elfinder/elfinder.min' %>

* Add the following to the view that will display elFinder:

    <%= javascript_tag do %>
      $().ready(function() { 
        $('#elfinder').elfinder({ 
          url: '/elfinder',
          lang: 'en'
        })
      })
    <% end %>
    <div id='elfinder'></div>

* That's it.  I think.  If not, check out the example rails application at http://github.com/phallstrom/el_finder-rails-example.
